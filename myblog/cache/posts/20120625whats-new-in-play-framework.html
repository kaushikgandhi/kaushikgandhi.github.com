<p><html><body><strong>how much time would you take to make a complete web app ?? </strong>
-&gt; use play you are just a command away &lt;-</p>
<p>programmers are working massively with great work load .</p>
<p>they need frameworks to create a structure and to take care</p>
<p>of all the routes and security purposes .programmers</p>
<p>are lazy and sont want to code all this again and again</p>
<p>so to take care of all this we always have good frameworks</p>
<p>like django,.net,ruby on rails etc .</p>
<p><strong>whats the basic difference on all this ?</strong></p>
<p>The difference lies not on programmers taste on language choice</p>
<p>they are not an issue .But the main issues are</p>
<p>-&gt;scalability</p>
<p>-&gt;security</p>
<p>-&gt;robustness</p>
<p>-&gt;platform</p>
<p>-&gt;deployment cost and issues</p>
<p>points to support play framework is better than others :</p>
<p>-&gt;its highly scalable</p>
<p>-&gt;with new japid templating engine its supports massively fast loading of pages</p>
<p>-&gt;supports scala , java commonly known languages</p>
<p>-&gt;rythm template</p>
<p>-&gt;dynamic objects passing to html files using json</p>
<p>Though play is new in market its already sucesfull .</p>
<p>Hope it serves more and people continue its use</body></html></p>
