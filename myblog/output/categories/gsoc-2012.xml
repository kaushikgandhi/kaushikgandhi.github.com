&lt;p&gt;I am in to gsoc preperation and now going quite messy .I have not been in touch with foss for quite a time now .Started off with looking arround with django (thought this could be a best option) .There has been a real good buzz about Askbot and Transifex &lt;a title="sayan chaudhary" href="http://fosswithme.blogspot.com"&gt;Sayan chaudhary&lt;/a&gt; a mate has really been in to this and he has nailed it quite good .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also thinking of looking into Gnome 3.0 bugs ,may be i can get a good option over there too. I have now started of to read the django book in mean while and gathering more information about previous projects related to django .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets hope for the best thats what i can do right now .&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>django</category><category>gsoc</category><category>gsoc</category><category>gsoc 2012</category><guid>http://localhost:8000/posts/20120211getting-ready-for-gsoc-2012.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2012 00:43:40 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
