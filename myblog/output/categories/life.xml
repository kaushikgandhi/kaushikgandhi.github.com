Its been 1 month now since i moved to banglore.&lt;br&gt; 
I thought of sharing my awesome experience in Indias largest IT hub.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How i started my journey&lt;/h4&gt;
Earlier in 2012 I started working with &lt;a href="http://reducedata.com"&gt;Reduce Data&lt;/a&gt; in chennai.&lt;br&gt;
The work was really intresting i got a mentor like &lt;a href="http://asifali.me/"&gt;Asif Ali&lt;/a&gt;, and was really enjoying my work.&lt;br&gt;
Initially chennai was good with lots of activities going arround with @chennaigeeks.&lt;br&gt;
But banglore have always been tempting with its super cool climate and offcourse lots of&lt;br&gt;activities 
with many geek communities in banglore.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Something that i had never experience before: &lt;/h4&gt;
I was coming back from my home town @Durgapur in Westbengal(India).&lt;br&gt;
It never happened before in train i heard someone explaining about MySql transactions&lt;br&gt; to his wife.
you don't find such companinons specially in trains , Atleast i never got similar co-passengers in 
my way to chennai , Soon i realized its banglore dude, and an intresting journey is about to start.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Finally @14th dec,13 I was in banglore.&lt;/h4&gt;
Since my arrival in banglore it had been a crazy journey meeting geeks, &lt;br&gt;
entrepreneurs and attending hackathons.
Some of my experience are worth mentioning.
&lt;h4&gt;#Waartaa&lt;/h4&gt;
It all started with hacking for  &lt;a href="http://www.rtnpro.com/waartaa-irc-client-as-a-service.html"&gt;#waartaa an Irc web-client as service &lt;/a&gt;. I met &lt;a href="http://rtnpro.com"&gt;@rtnpro&lt;/a&gt;.
he guided me through on learning node and meteor to get-started with #waartaa. 
Experimented with few new technologies "NodeJs" , "Meteor" , "Mongodb". &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;#A bit of scraping work with @Rashmi Ranjan Padhy&lt;/h4&gt;
I was quite excited to meet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rashmiranjan"&gt;Rashmi ranjan&lt;/a&gt; founder of banglore startups and currently trying to launch his new startup http://techchamp.co .With Rashmi, I started with something offbeat to my previous experience . I started on to scrapping &lt;a href="http://reddit.com"&gt;reddit.com&lt;/a&gt; and Hacker News with beautiful soup [python].
&lt;a href="http://news.ycombinator.com"&gt;Hacker news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h6&gt;Note: Yes offcouse following there robots.txt. &lt;br&gt;
 Disclaimer: Hacker News went down on 6th january 2014 that was not us :p. &lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;#hackathon 31st december geekNight by @hasgeek"&lt;/h4&gt;
Soon 2013 was about to end and in geek style. &lt;br&gt;
I along with @rtnpro and @sayan_chowdhary went to geeknight organized by @hasgeek.&lt;br&gt;
So we went on hacking with our #waartaa project. &lt;br&gt;
@sayan gave a wonderful demo :
