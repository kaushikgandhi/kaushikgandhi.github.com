<html><body><p>I was not sure if i could participate this year being a final year student in college .But gsoc 2012 #faqs made it quite clear , that i have nothing to fear.


I am in to gsoc preperation and now going quite messy .I have not been in touch with foss for quite a time now .Started off with looking arround with django (thought this could be a best option) .There has been a real good buzz about Askbot and Transifex <a title="sayan chaudhary" href="http://fosswithme.blogspot.com">Sayan chaudhary</a> a mate has really been in to this and he has nailed it quite good .



I am also thinking of looking into Gnome 3.0 bugs ,may be i can get a good option over there too. I have now started of to read the django book in mean while and gathering more information about previous projects related to django .



Lets hope for the best thats what i can do right now .</p></body></html>
