<html><body><strong>how much time would you take to make a complete web app ?? </strong>
-&gt; use play you are just a command away &lt;-

programmers are working massively with great work load .

they need frameworks to create a structure and to take care

of all the routes and security purposes .programmers

are lazy and sont want to code all this again and again

so to take care of all this we always have good frameworks

like django,.net,ruby on rails etc .



<strong>whats the basic difference on all this ?</strong>



The difference lies not on programmers taste on language choice

they are not an issue .But the main issues are



-&gt;scalability

-&gt;security

-&gt;robustness

-&gt;platform

-&gt;deployment cost and issues



points to support play framework is better than others :



-&gt;its highly scalable

-&gt;with new japid templating engine its supports massively fast loading of pages

-&gt;supports scala , java commonly known languages

-&gt;rythm template

-&gt;dynamic objects passing to html files using json



Though play is new in market its already sucesfull .

Hope it serves more and people continue its use</body></html>
