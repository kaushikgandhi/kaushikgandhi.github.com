I met @rtnpro.\nhe guided me through on learning node and meteor to get-started with #waartaa. \nExperimented with few new technologies \"NodeJs\" , \"Meteor\" , \"Mongodb\". \n#A bit of scraping work with @Rashmi Ranjan Padhy\nI was quite excited to meet Rashmi ranjan founder of banglore startups and currently trying to launch his new startup http://techchamp.co .With Rashmi, I started with something offbeat to my previous experience . I started on to scrapping reddit.com and Hacker news with beautiful soup [python].\n.Note: Yes offcouse following there robots.txt. \n Disclaimer: Hacker News went down on 6th january 2014 that was not us :p. \n\n#hackathon 31st december geekNight by @hasgeek\"\nSoon 2013 was about to end and in geek style. \nI along with @rtnpro and @sayan_chowdhary went to geeknight organized by @hasgeek.\nSo we went on hacking with our #waartaa project. \n@sayan gave a wonderful demo :",
