<p>
Its been 1 month now since i moved to banglore.<br> 
I thought of sharing my awesome experience in Indias largest IT hub.<br>
</p>
<p><h4>How i started my journey</h4>
Earlier in 2012 I started working with <a href="http://reducedata.com">Reduce Data</a> in chennai.<br>
The work was really intresting i got a mentor like <a href="http://asifali.me/" >Asif Ali</a>, and was really enjoying my work.<br>
Initially chennai was good with lots of activities going arround with @chennaigeeks.<br>
But banglore have always been tempting with its super cool climate and offcourse lots of<br>activities 
with many geek communities in banglore.
</p>
<p>
<h4>Something that i had never experience before: </h4>
I was coming back from my home town @Durgapur in Westbengal(India).<br>
It never happened before in train i heard someone explaining about MySql transactions<br> to his wife.
you don't find such companinons specially in trains , Atleast i never got similar co-passengers in 
my way to chennai , Soon i realized its banglore dude, and an intresting journey is about to start.

<h4>Finally @14th dec,13 I was in banglore.</h4>
Since my arrival in banglore it had been a crazy journey meeting geeks, <br>
entrepreneurs and attending hackathons.
Some of my experience are worth mentioning.</p>
<h4>#Waartaa</h4>
It all started with hacking for  <a href="http://www.rtnpro.com/waartaa-irc-client-as-a-service.html">#waartaa an Irc web-client as service </a>. I met <a href="http://rtnpro.com">@rtnpro</a>.

Experimented with few new technologies "NodeJs" , "Meteor" , "Mongodb". <br>

<h4>#A bit of scraping work with @Rashmi Ranjan Padhy</h4>
I was quite excited to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/rashmiranjan">Rashmi ranjan</a> founder of banglore startups and currently trying to launch his new startup http://techchamp.co .With Rashmi, I started with something offbeat to my previous experience . I started on to scrapping <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit.com</a> and Hacker News with beautiful soup [python].
